Preliminary clinical data from South Africa suggest that the COVID-19 Omicron variant may be less dangerous than initially feared. 

The South African Medical Research Council posted a report on Saturday outlining early Omicron cases from several hospitals. They found that patients infected with the Omicron strain tended to have less severe disease—most of the hospitalized patients did not need supplemental oxygen, a few developed COVID pneumonia, and fewer still required intensive care.

Extractive Summarization:
The South African report is based on limited data, however. It included just 166 patients, most of whom were admitted to hospitals for reasons unrelated to COVID-19—their infections were only found because those hospitals are testing all incoming patients for the coronavirus. Many did not have respiratory symptoms and stayed at the hospital for a relatively short time. 
Article Section:
 

"The signals are a bit encouraging" but Omicron's risk profile is still incomplete, Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Sunday. More clinical data from around the world will need to be assessed for epidemiologists to get a true sense of where Omicron stands in relation to other variants. "Clearly, in South Africa, Omicron has a transmission advantage," Fauci added, "although it's too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it."

The South African report is based on limited data, however. It included just 166 patients, most of whom were admitted to hospitals for reasons unrelated to COVID-19—their infections were only found because those hospitals are testing all incoming patients for the coronavirus. Many did not have respiratory symptoms and stayed at the hospital for a relatively short time. Vaccination status was not reported for all of the patients.

"We're just not seeing the number of patients that have been seen in previous surges who are seriously ill, even this soon into the surge," Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, told STAT, adding that he is "impressed by the relative lack of severe illness" with Omicron so far. 

Data from the South African report show that the patients included tended to skew younger, which the report's authors write could be a vaccination effect, "as 57 percent of people over the age of 50 have been vaccinated in the province compared to 34 percent in the 18-to-49-year group."

Although Omicron appears to produce milder disease, scientists will need to study the effects of Omicron in different demographics, Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told STAT.

Although Omicron appears to produce milder disease, scientists will need to study the effects of Omicron in different demographics, Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told STAT. "Only once we have seen this spread across age groups, we will be able to tell," she said.

Omicron has been detected in at least 16 states and at least 45 nations worldwide. Nevertheless, the Delta variant still seems to be the primary cause for concern, making up the majority of severe cases in the US—despite Omicron's high transmissibility.

Omicron may have picked up genetic materials from the virus that causes the common cold in humans, resulting in the variant's high contagiousness. 
Article Section:


Omicron may have picked up genetic materials from the virus that causes the common cold in humans, resulting in the variant's high contagiousness. A preprint, non-peer-reviewed study from a Massachusetts-based firm says that Omicron's genetic code contains a sequence shared with the cold virus—a sequence that no other coronavirus variant seems to contain.

"By virtue of Omicron adopting this insertion ... it is essentially taking a leaf out of the seasonal coronaviruses' page, which [explains] ... how it lives and transmits more efficiently with human beings," Venky Soundararajan, a biological engineer at Nference who co-wrote the study, told The Washington Post.



The biggest ancient city you’ve probably never heard of is in Illinois

Extractive Summarization:
Just a river's crossing away from St. Louis, Missouri, rests an ancient and mysterious anthropological site that few Americans know of. Scholars still discuss the potential reasons for the demise of Cahokia, a massive settlement that may have housed as many as 20,000 people by 1050 A.D.

Just a river's crossing away from St. Louis, Missouri, rests an ancient and mysterious anthropological site that few Americans know of. Scholars still discuss the potential reasons for the demise of Cahokia, a massive settlement that may have housed as many as 20,000 people by 1050 A.D. The metropolis, which sits in the fertile floodplain of the Mississippi River Valley that's now western Illinois, was made up of towering, handmade earthen mounds, the largest of which still exists at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site. While there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to this ancient civilization, including why it disappeared, remains have helped researchers paint a picture of what the city was like at its peak.

Ancient teeth at this site hint that it was home to a diverse group of Indigenous people. Roughly a third of the population came to Cahokia from other areas in middle America, based on the varying strontium levels in the dental fragments. The architecture is telling too: The organization of the mounds in Cahokia leads archeologists to believe this city had some level of urban planning, and was not just a collection of villages. Rulers lived on top of mounds, looking down at the structures other inhabitants lived in. Farming, hunting, logging, pottery, and weaving were all conducted inside this massive city.

Article Section:
 

In the center of Cahokia, surrounding the biggest mound of roughly 100 feet tall, sat the city center, encircled by a massive wooden palisade. The area held a plaza that archeologists believe was inspired by the creators concept of the cosmos at the time, with the four corners marking the cardinal directions. Researchers believe this town center, and the buildings on top of the central mound, were actually where religious ceremonies and events took place. It's even possible that people traveled from outside of Cahokia just to attend these gatherings. 

As for why Cahokia fell, a few theories have come into play, but with conflicting evidence. For a while, it was believed that the residents' dependence on wood for their structures led to over deforestation of the land, which ultimately made it less fertile. But soil samples show that the land would still have been fertile shortly after the fall of Cahokia. Colonists did not reach this space until much later, making disease an unlikely calamity as well. Other experts believe that fighting with neighboring groups may have caused Cahokia's fall.

This tiny AI-powered robot is learning to explore the ocean on its own
Charlotte Hu


Section 1:

Extractive Summarization:
The ocean is big, and our attempts to understand it are still largely surface-deep. More recently, robotic buoys called Argo floats have been drifting with the currents, diving up and down to take a variety of measurements at depths up to 6,500 feet. Everything that CARL does is powered by a microcontroller inside, which has a 1-megabyte processor that's smaller than a postage stamp. 
Article Section:
The ocean is big, and our attempts to understand it are still largely surface-deep. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization, around 80 percent of the big blue is "unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored." Ships are the primary way to collect information about the seas, but they're costly to send out frequently. More recently, robotic buoys called Argo floats have been drifting with the currents, diving up and down to take a variety of measurements at depths up to 6,500 feet. But new aquatic robots from a lab at Caltech could rove deeper and take on more tailored underwater missions. "We're imagining an approach for global ocean exploration where you take swarms of smaller robots of various types and populate the ocean with them for tracking, for climate change, for understanding the physics of the ocean," says John O. Dabiri, a professor of aeronautics and mechanical engineering at the California Institute of Technology.  In comes CARL-Bot (Caltech Autonomous Reinforcement Learning Robot), a palm-sized aquatic robot that looks like a cross between a pill capsule and a dumbo octopus. It has motors for swimming around, is weighted to stay upright, and has sensors that can detect pressure, depth, acceleration, and orientation. Everything that CARL does is powered by a microcontroller inside, which has a 1-megabyte processor that's smaller than a postage stamp. CARL is the latest ocean-traversing innovation out of Dabiri's lab, created and 3D-printed at home by Caltech graduate student Peter Gunnarson. The first tests Gunnarson ran with it were in his bathtub, since Caltech's labs were closed at the start of 2021 because of COVID.  Right now, CARL can still be remotely controlled. But to really get to the deepest parts of the ocean, there can't be any hand-holding involved. That means no researchers giving CARL directions—it needs to learn to navigate the mighty ocean on its own. Gunnarson and Dabiri sought out computer scientist Petros Koumoutsakos, who helped develop AI algorithms for CARL that could teach it to orient itself based on changes in its immediate environment and past experiences. Their research was published this week in Nature Communications. CARL can decide to adjust its route on-the-fly to maneuver around the rough currents and get to its destination. Or it can stay put in a designated location using "minimal energy" from a lithium-ion battery. 


Section 2:

Extractive Summarization:
"We can use that information to decide how to navigate those situations in the future," explains Dabiri. CARL's programming enables it to remember similar paths it has taken in previous missions, and "over repeated experiences, get better and better at sampling the ocean with less time and less energy," Gunnarson adds. But transferring that to the real world can be messy. 
Article Section:
The set of algorithms developed by Koumoutsakos can perform the wayfinding calculations on-board the small robot. The algorithms also take advantage of the robot's memory of prior encounters, like how to get past a whirlpool. "We can use that information to decide how to navigate those situations in the future," explains Dabiri.  CARL's programming enables it to remember similar paths it has taken in previous missions, and "over repeated experiences, get better and better at sampling the ocean with less time and less energy," Gunnarson adds.   A lot of machine learning is done in simulation, where all the data points are clean. But transferring that to the real world can be messy. Sensors sometimes get overwhelmed and might not pick up all the necessary metrics. "We're just starting the trials in the physical tank," says Gunnarson. The first step is to test if CARL can complete simple tasks, like repeated diving. A short video on Caltech's blog shows the robot clumsily bobbing along and plunging into a still water tank.  As testing moves along, the team plans to put CARL in a pool-like tank with small jets that can generate horizontal currents for it to navigate through. When the robot graduates from that, it will move to a two-story-tall facility that can mimic upwelling and downwelling currents. There, it will have to figure out how to maintain a certain depth in a region where the surrounding water is flowing in all directions.  "Ultimately, though, we want CARL in the real world. He'll leave the nest and go into the ocean and with repeated trials there, the goal would be for him to learn how to navigate on his own," says Dabiri.   During the testing, the team will also adjust the sensors in and on CARL. "One of the questions we had is what is the minimal set of sensors that you can put onboard to accomplish the task," Dabiri says. When a robot is decked out with tools like LiDAR or cameras, "that limits the ability of the system to go for very long in the ocean before you have to change the battery." By lightening the sensor load, researchers could lengthen CARL's life and open up space to add scientific instruments to measure pH, salinity, temperature, and more.

It's possible that adding a chip that harbors similar machine learning algorithms to CARL's would enable researchers to better steer the jellies through the ocean. In this regard, CARL provides a testing vessel for the algorithms that could eventually go into the mechanically modified creatures. 
Article Section:
Early last year, Dabiri's group published a paper on how they used electric zaps to control a jellyfish's movements. It's possible that adding a chip that harbors similar machine learning algorithms to CARL's would enable researchers to better steer the jellies through the ocean. "Figuring out how this navigation algorithm works on a real live jellyfish could take a lot of time and effort," says Dabiri. In this regard, CARL provides a testing vessel for the algorithms that could eventually go into the mechanically modified creatures. Unlike robots and rovers, these jellies wouldn't have depth limitations, as biologists know that they can exist in the Mariana Trench, some 30,000 feet below the surface. CARL, in and of itself, can still be an useful asset in ocean monitoring. It can work alongside existing instruments like Argo floats, and go on solo missions to perform more fine-tuned explorations, given that it can get close to sea beds and other fragile structures. It can also track and tag along with biological organisms like a school of fish.  "You might one day in the future imagine 10,000 or a million CARLs (we'll give them different names, I guess) all going out into the ocean to measure regions that we simply can't access today simultaneously so that we get a time-resolved picture of how the ocean is changing," Dabiri says. "That's going to be really essential to model predictions of climate, but also to understand how the ocean works."  



The ‘doomsday’ glacier is on the brink of collapse

One of the ever-looming threats of climate change is sea level rise, which already threatens to displace millions of people worldwide and force them to move inland by the end of the century. A big part of the rising water levels are hotter temperatures at the poles—home to giant glaciers and ice shelves that hold crucial quantities of frozen H2O.

Extractive Summarization:
 The Florida-sized Thwaites glacier in Antarctica, nicknamed the "doomsday glacier," is already losing 50 billion tons of ice each year. 
Article Section:
 

The Florida-sized Thwaites glacier in Antarctica, nicknamed the "doomsday glacier," is already losing 50 billion tons of ice each year. That in itself accounts for around 4 percent of annual global sea level rise. But unpublished research shared at the American Geophysical Union fall meeting this week shows that the thinning ice shelf extending from Thwaites could shatter within the next three to five years. Behind Thwaites lies an even larger body of ice that, if the glacier melts, will be exposed to increasingly warm waters.


Section 3:

Extractive Summarization:
"Thwaites is the widest glacier in the world," Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and lead coordinator for the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), said in a press release. And it could lead to even more sea level rise, up to 10 feet, if it draws the surrounding glaciers with it." 
Article Section:


"Thwaites is the widest glacier in the world," Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and lead coordinator for the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), said in a press release. "It's doubled its outflow speed within the last 30 years, and the glacier in its entirety holds enough water to raise [global] sea levels by over two feet. And it could lead to even more sea level rise, up to 10 feet, if it draws the surrounding glaciers with it." 

Thwaites has been in trouble for a while now—and scientists have been trying to figure out how exactly climate change will impact the rate of melting on it and other vulnerable glaciers. These new insights, however, show that the warming Southern Ocean is melting the ice from below, forming large cracks across the floating ice shelf. 

"I visualize it somewhat similar to that car window where you have a few cracks that are slowly propagating, and then suddenly you go over a bump in your car and the whole thing just starts to shatter in every direction," Erin Pettit, a glaciologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, said at the meeting on December 13.

The ice shelf is a floating part of the glacier held steady by an "underwater mountain," according to the CIRES release. If cracked, it's only a matter of time until all that ice can melt and rush into the ocean. "What's most concerning about the recent results is that it's pointing to a collapse of this ice shelf, this kind of safety band that holds the ice on the land," Peter Davis, oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN. "If we lose this ice shelf, then the glacier will flow into the ocean more quickly, contributing towards sea level rise."

Extractive Summarization:
Warming water creeping underneath the glacier also causes the ice to lose its grip on the "grounding zone"—the section of seabed holding the glacier in place. Peter Washam, a research associate at Cornell University, discovered through a remote-controlled underwater robot that the grounding floor is in "chaotic" shape due to warm water, rugged ice, and a steeply sloped base.

Peter Washam, a research associate at Cornell University, discovered through a remote-controlled underwater robot that the grounding floor is in "chaotic" shape due to warm water, rugged ice, and a steeply sloped base. Tides additionally pump warm water between the bedrock and the glacier, further impacting stability. 

"If Thwaites were to collapse, it would drag most of West Antarctica's ice with it," Scambos said in the release. "So it's critical to get a clearer picture of how the glacier will behave over the next 100 years." Research from the ITGC, a group of 100 scientists making up the largest UK-US project on the southern continent in 70 years, will continue surveying Thwaites's shaky future.



How worried should we be about solar flares and space weather?

Section 1:

Extractive Summarization:
Those explosions of solar radiation make up what is called "space weather." "Our star is really an enormous thermonuclear furnace. Every second, those four million missing tons are transformed into energy—what we see as sunshine. 
Article Section:
The sun roils with heat as thermonuclear reactions in its center produce high amounts of energy. Day to day, that energy is responsible for making Earth livable. But sometimes, solar radiation can burst forth, sending highly energetic particles hurtling at top speeds into space. If our planet is in the radiation's path, it can wreak havoc on our lives.  Those explosions of solar radiation make up what is called "space weather." And it can be just as disruptive as terrestrial weather, though maybe not as frequently as the headlines warn. "Our star is really an enormous thermonuclear furnace. At its center, the temperature is between 15 to 17 million degrees Celsius, and roughly 600 million tons of hydrogen get fused into 596 million tons of helium," says Madhulika Guhathakurta, program scientist for NASA's Heliophysics Division and lead program scientist for the "Living With a Star" initiative, which studies the ways in which Sun-Earth system affects human life and society. Every second, those four million missing tons are transformed into energy—what we see as sunshine. But "even a slight change in this very precariously controlled activity can have drastic consequences on Earth," she explains.  Although such consequences are rare, satellites and technology that relies on electricity and wireless networks are particularly vulnerable. In 1989, a geomagnetic storm set off by a powerful solar flare triggered a major blackout across Canada that left six million people without electricity for nine hours. In 2000, a solar eruption caused some satellites to short-circuit and led to radio blackout. In 2003, a series of solar eruptions caused power outages and disrupted air travel and satellite systems. And in February 2022, a geomagnetic storm destroyed at least 40 Starlink satellites just as they were being deployed, costing SpaceX more than $50 million. 


Section 2:

Extractive Summarization:
When that radiation slams into Earth, it injects energy into our planet's ionosphere, the uppermost reaches of our atmosphere, explains Guhathakurta. The extreme ultraviolet radiation from the sun can polarize the particles in Earth's ionosphere, she says, which can have cascading effects on any other charged particles in the vicinity-meaning anything that uses electricity is at risk. And that is a challenging science problem that we have not yet cracked." 
Article Section:
Generally speaking, the term "solar storm" describes when an intense eruption of energy from the sun shoots into space and interacts with Earth. Charged particles constantly flow away from the sun into space in what is called the solar wind. But more significant eruptions can originate as solar flares, often from temporarily dark patches called sunspots, and intense explosions called coronal mass ejections. Any kind of variation in this activity can cause auroras.  Solar flares are essentially flashes of light. They happen when strong solar magnetic fields protruding from the surface of the sun snap, releasing immense amounts of electromagnetic radiation at extremely high speeds. When that radiation slams into Earth, it injects energy into our planet's ionosphere, the uppermost reaches of our atmosphere, explains Guhathakurta. The extreme ultraviolet radiation from the sun can polarize the particles in Earth's ionosphere, she says, which can have cascading effects on any other charged particles in the vicinity-meaning anything that uses electricity is at risk. And solar flares travel at the speed of light, says Jesse Woodroffe, who leads the space weather research program in NASA's Heliophysics Division. That makes them difficult to anticipate and prepare for. "There is no way to get a signal to Earth faster than the solar flares, which are already traveling at the speed of light," he notes. "So you have to predict the flare itself is going to happen. And that is a challenging science problem that we have not yet cracked." While solar flares are intense bursts of radiation, coronal mass ejections are explosions of energy particles. As such, they travel a bit slower. They occur when large portions of the outer atmosphere of the sun (the corona) explodes, sending superheated gas out into space. These "big blobs of solar material are ejected out at a very high speed, hundreds and hundreds of kilometers per second, but it is much slower than the speed of light," Woodroffe adds. Those can take anywhere from half a day to three days to reach Earth, he says.

Extractive Summarization:
Forecasting space weather isn't quite like terrestrial weather forecasts. "We don't have a great picture of what happens between the sun and the Earth," he explains. Lagrange points are rare spots between the Earth and the sun where the gravity of the two objects pulls on a satellite equally to hold it in place. 
Article Section:
Forecasting space weather isn't quite like terrestrial weather forecasts. The big difference: On Earth, meteorologists have millions of measurements they can make and integrate into their predictive models. In space, Woodroffe says, there are just a few places scientists can put instruments to observe solar activity. "We don't have a great picture of what happens between the sun and the Earth," he explains. "There are very few places where you can put a reliable asset to just sit there and watch because satellites in orbit move." Lagrange points are rare spots between the Earth and the sun where the gravity of the two objects pulls on a satellite equally to hold it in place. That's where NASA has placed their "most vital space weather monitors," Woodroffe says, including a joint venture with the European Space Agency (ESA). The ESA is developing another mission, called Vigil, to place a spacecraft at a Lagrange point next to the sun by the end of this decade. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, meanwhile, studies the sun while orbiting Earth. With their cameras and sensors, scientists monitor the sun for a change in the brightness emerging from its surface, Woodroffe explains. A surge in brightness might appear for only a few frames—and only last for a matter of seconds. NASA shares the data from its solar observatories with the National Oceanic at Atmospheric Administration, which provides a probabilistic forecast of geomagnetic storm warnings and watches based on likelihood and geomagnetic intensity. Depending on how fast a solar storm is moving, they can send out warnings a few days before that space weather touches Earth, or just a couple of hours. The ultimate goal, Woodroffe says, is to improve space weather forecasting to be on par with hurricane forecasting. His Earth-focused colleagues can predict where a hurricane might go by running different models, producing a range of outcomes within a high range of confidence, he says. "We are developing those sorts of capabilities for space weather."

Space weather activity hasn't changed recently, says Guhathakurta—but humanity has. And with growing dependence on devices that rely on orbiting satellite systems like GPS, our electronics are even more exposed to bursts of solar radiation. To mitigate the risk of blackouts and instruments being fried by a solar storm, technology companies can build backup power systems and other redundancies into their devices, and strategically turn them off when NOAA's space weather forecasting system flags a high risk. 
Article Section:
So, back to those apocalyptic solar flare headlines. Is the sun really getting feistier and threatening the collapse of modern society each week?  Space weather activity hasn't changed recently, says Guhathakurta—but humanity has. In the past century, people have become increasingly reliant on electronics, and anything with an "on and off switch is vulnerable to solar storms," she says.  When those energy particles come surging from the sun to Earth, the disturbance they cause in our planet's magnetic field "creates electromagnetic fluctuation and voltage fluctuation, which can penetrate beneath the ground and create fluctuations on our electric power grid," Guhathakurta says. And with growing dependence on devices that rely on orbiting satellite systems like GPS, our electronics are even more exposed to bursts of solar radiation. To mitigate the risk of blackouts and instruments being fried by a solar storm, technology companies can build backup power systems and other redundancies into their devices, and strategically turn them off when NOAA's space weather forecasting system flags a high risk. "Human civilization has been extending from our Earth-based domain into the heliosphere, or the domain of the sun," Guhathakurta says. "We are no longer simply observing an environment which is beyond our reach, but we are actually living in it, doing commerce in it, and traveling in it. Therefore, we have to really gain the level of understanding that is required to develop and inhabit this new world." Correction August 2, 2022: This article has been updated to clarify the location of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which is not at a Lagrange point. The observatory is in geosynchronous orbit around Earth.  



The case for paying carbon taxes on unsustainable food
Carla Delgado


Section 1:

Extractive Summarization:
Minimizing the risk of living on an unlivable planet requires significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through various means, like shifting to renewable energy and electrifying sectors that rely on fossil fuels. 
Article Section:
Minimizing the risk of living on an unlivable planet requires significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through various means, like shifting to renewable energy and electrifying sectors that rely on fossil fuels. In countries like Finland and Sweden, taxes play a key climate role, especially when it comes to policies that charge a fee based on the carbon content of fossil fuels. However, emissions caused by agriculture must be addressed, too. "The food we eat is the biggest cause of biodiversity loss in the world and the second biggest source of greenhouse gasses, so it's very difficult to address those problems without considering the food system," says Ian Bateman, co-director of the Land, Environment, Economics and Policy Institute (LEEP) at the University of Exeter. Is there a way to take the idea of carbon taxing to the grocery aisle? New research suggests that tax policies could minimize GHG emissions and improve dietary quality at the same time. But they may have a disproportionate impact on low-income communities if implemented inefficiently. 


Section 2:

Extractive Summarization:
According to a new Nature Food study, a combined carbon and health tax policy on food products would significantly impact consumers' purchasing decisions. The authors considered two approaches to address biodiversity loss and increasing GHG emissions: providing information about food products' carbon and health impacts and imposing taxes based on their carbon and health impacts. Looking at shopping lists before and after policy interventions permitted the authors to see the effect of different policies on food purchase behavior and, subsequently, on GHG emissions and dietary quality. 
Article Section:
According to a new Nature Food study, a combined carbon and health tax policy on food products would significantly impact consumers' purchasing decisions. These taxes would apply to carbon-intensive foods like beef or unhealthy foods like alcohol and sugary drinks. A healthier and more environment-friendly grocery run can reduce GHG emissions and improve the quality of diets at the same time. The authors considered two approaches to address biodiversity loss and increasing GHG emissions: providing information about food products' carbon and health impacts and imposing taxes based on their carbon and health impacts. The authors, including Exeter's Bateman, conducted a survey by replicating an online supermarket to determine how information about carbon or health impacts, taxation, and combined information and tax affected consumers' purchasing decisions. Almost 6,000 participants reported their usual food and beverage purchases for the baseline scenario.  Afterward, they were presented with the same list of products but with additional product information or new prices, depending on the hypothetical policy instrument. They faced one of three scenarios: carbon information and tax policies, health information and tax policies, or an unexplained tax followed by carbon and health information. After product info was added or prices changed due to the chosen policy instrument, participants were allowed to revise their food purchase choices if they wanted to. Looking at shopping lists before and after policy interventions permitted the authors to see the effect of different policies on food purchase behavior and, subsequently, on GHG emissions and dietary quality. Both measures—providing carbon or health information and adding carbon or health taxes—helped move consumption towards healthier or lower-emissions foods, says Bateman. "Taxes were more effective than information, but the biggest effect is when both are used together," he adds. 


Section 3:

Extractive Summarization:
The concern about carbon and health taxes is the potential disproportionate burden on low-income communities. It's important to ask whether different demographic groups spend the same proportion of household incomes on specific food products. Revenue neutral means that the government's overall tax revenue does not change. 
Article Section:
The concern about carbon and health taxes is the potential disproportionate burden on low-income communities. The poor might be unable to afford even a slight price increase on commodities like food or fuel, leaving them even more vulnerable.  It's important to ask whether different demographic groups spend the same proportion of household incomes on specific food products. If not, carbon and health taxes may have a different impact on high- and low-income communities, says Aseem Prakash, professor of political science at the University of Washington, Seattle and founding director of the UW Center for Environmental Politics. Health taxes (also called sin taxes) on food, alcohol, tobacco, and soft drinks generally take a greater share of income from the poor than from the wealthy. Revenue recycling, or using the tax revenue for a designated purpose that will benefit society, can help mitigate the regressive effects of carbon taxes, says Prakash. For instance, tax revenues could fund public transit, social safety net programs, and public school education. "The money raised by the taxes should be used to reduce other taxes on the poor—such as income tax—until you reach the point where the income [tax] of the poor is fully compensated for the price rises," says Bateman. "There will still be an incentive to buy lower tax foods so they are still effective in changing purchasing, but the tax redistribution means the poor can now afford to buy more high health, low carbon foods." Bateman adds that these tax policies must be revenue neutral to avoid a disproportionate impact on low-income communities, who are most likely to be affected by climate change and health problems. Revenue neutral means that the government's overall tax revenue does not change. Instead, the gains from taxing high-emission and unhealthy food products are utilized and returned to the public.  Taxes on food alone will not change the food system entirely. However, they can be part of a broader range of policy measures, such as cutting subsidies for producing unhealthy and high-emission foods and boosting investments toward producing healthy and environmentally friendly foods, says Bateman. After all, taxing certain foods only helps if good alternatives are available.  "There are several other tools that can be used as well, including information campaigns," says Prakash. "If we want individuals to drive less, we must give them low-carbon options to meet their transportation needs. Thus, taxes could shape behaviors more effectively if individuals have other options with similar costs and convenience."

Preliminary clinical data from South Africa suggest that the COVID-19 Omicron variant may be less dangerous than initially feared. 

The South African Medical Research Council posted a report on Saturday outlining early Omicron cases from several hospitals. They found that patients infected with the Omicron strain tended to have less severe disease—most of the hospitalized patients did not need supplemental oxygen, a few developed COVID pneumonia, and fewer still required intensive care.

 "The signals are a bit encouraging" but Omicron's risk profile is still incomplete, Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Sunday. More clinical data from around the world will need to be assessed for epidemiologists to get a true sense of where Omicron stands in relation to other variants. "We're just not seeing the number of patients that have been seen in previous surges who are seriously ill, even this soon into the surge," Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, told STAT, adding that he is "impressed by the relative lack of severe illness" with Omicron so far.

"The signals are a bit encouraging" but Omicron's risk profile is still incomplete, Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Sunday. More clinical data from around the world will need to be assessed for epidemiologists to get a true sense of where Omicron stands in relation to other variants. "Clearly, in South Africa, Omicron has a transmission advantage," Fauci added, "although it's too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it."

The South African report is based on limited data, however. It included just 166 patients, most of whom were admitted to hospitals for reasons unrelated to COVID-19—their infections were only found because those hospitals are testing all incoming patients for the coronavirus. Many did not have respiratory symptoms and stayed at the hospital for a relatively short time. Vaccination status was not reported for all of the patients.

"We're just not seeing the number of patients that have been seen in previous surges who are seriously ill, even this soon into the surge," Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, told STAT, adding that he is "impressed by the relative lack of severe illness" with Omicron so far. 

Data from the South African report show that the patients included tended to skew younger, which the report's authors write could be a vaccination effect, "as 57 percent of people over the age of 50 have been vaccinated in the province compared to 34 percent in the 18-to-49-year group."

Although Omicron appears to produce milder disease, scientists will need to study the effects of Omicron in different demographics, Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told STAT.

Although Omicron appears to produce milder disease, scientists will need to study the effects of Omicron in different demographics, Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told STAT. "Only once we have seen this spread across age groups, we will be able to tell," she said.

Omicron has been detected in at least 16 states and at least 45 nations worldwide. Nevertheless, the Delta variant still seems to be the primary cause for concern, making up the majority of severe cases in the US—despite Omicron's high transmissibility.


Section 4:

Extractive Summarization:
Omicron may have picked up genetic materials from the virus that causes the common cold in humans, resulting in the variant's high contagiousness. A preprint, non-peer-reviewed study from a Massachusetts-based firm says that Omicron's genetic code contains a sequence shared with the cold virus—a sequence that no other coronavirus variant seems to contain.

"By virtue of Omicron adopting this insertion ... it is essentially taking a leaf out of the seasonal coronaviruses' page, which [explains] ... how it lives and transmits more efficiently with human beings," Venky Soundararajan, a biological engineer at Nference who co-wrote the study, told The Washington Post.



The biggest ancient city you’ve probably never heard of is in Illinois

Just a river's crossing away from St. Louis, Missouri, rests an ancient and mysterious anthropological site that few Americans know of. Scholars still discuss the potential reasons for the demise of Cahokia, a massive settlement that may have housed as many as 20,000 people by 1050 A.D.

Just a river's crossing away from St. Louis, Missouri, rests an ancient and mysterious anthropological site that few Americans know of. Scholars still discuss the potential reasons for the demise of Cahokia, a massive settlement that may have housed as many as 20,000 people by 1050 A.D. The metropolis, which sits in the fertile floodplain of the Mississippi River Valley that's now western Illinois, was made up of towering, handmade earthen mounds, the largest of which still exists at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site. While there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to this ancient civilization, including why it disappeared, remains have helped researchers paint a picture of what the city was like at its peak.

 Ancient teeth at this site hint that it was home to a diverse group of Indigenous people. Roughly a third of the population came to Cahokia from other areas in middle America, based on the varying strontium levels in the dental fragments.

Ancient teeth at this site hint that it was home to a diverse group of Indigenous people. Roughly a third of the population came to Cahokia from other areas in middle America, based on the varying strontium levels in the dental fragments. The architecture is telling too: The organization of the mounds in Cahokia leads archeologists to believe this city had some level of urban planning, and was not just a collection of villages. Rulers lived on top of mounds, looking down at the structures other inhabitants lived in. Farming, hunting, logging, pottery, and weaving were all conducted inside this massive city.

The area held a plaza that archeologists believe was inspired by the creators concept of the cosmos at the time, with the four corners marking the cardinal directions. As for why Cahokia fell, a few theories have come into play, but with conflicting evidence. Colonists did not reach this space until much later, making disease an unlikely calamity as well.

In the center of Cahokia, surrounding the biggest mound of roughly 100 feet tall, sat the city center, encircled by a massive wooden palisade. The area held a plaza that archeologists believe was inspired by the creators concept of the cosmos at the time, with the four corners marking the cardinal directions. Researchers believe this town center, and the buildings on top of the central mound, were actually where religious ceremonies and events took place. It's even possible that people traveled from outside of Cahokia just to attend these gatherings. 

As for why Cahokia fell, a few theories have come into play, but with conflicting evidence. For a while, it was believed that the residents' dependence on wood for their structures led to over deforestation of the land, which ultimately made it less fertile. But soil samples show that the land would still have been fertile shortly after the fall of Cahokia. Colonists did not reach this space until much later, making disease an unlikely calamity as well. Other experts believe that fighting with neighboring groups may have caused Cahokia's fall.

Today, the mounds comprise a city park and state historic site, but are in consideration for a national park designation. 

Article Section:


Today, the mounds comprise a city park and state historic site, but are in consideration for a national park designation. Visitors can climb the steps of the highest mound still standing at Cahokia, among more than 65 other preserved mounds. It's one of the few places in the US where people can freely walk through a millennia-old metropolis.
